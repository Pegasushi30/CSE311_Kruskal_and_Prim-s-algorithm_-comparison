# CSE311_Kruskal_and_Prim-s-algorithm_-comparison

This term project
aims to comprehensively understand Prim's and Kruskal's
algorithms, two fundamental algorithms used for MSTs. The primary
objective is to implement both algorithms, perform an empirical
analysis on their performance, and prepare a detailed report of the
findings.


Description of
the Project:

The term project
will involve the following key activities:


Understanding Prim's
and Kruskal's algorithms: Start with a thorough study of the
theoretical foundations of both algorithms. You can check existing
codes available on the Internet.


Implementation:
Implement both algorithms in a programming language of your choice.
The implementation should be clear, and efficient, and handle
graph inputs of varying sizes and complexities. The input can be read
from a text file.For each input instance, use a separate file.


Empirical
Analysis: Design a series of experiments to compare the
performance of both algorithms. Performance should be measured in
terms of time complexity. You need to design your tests for a variety
of conditions â€“ different graph densities (sparse/dense), and
different graph sizes (number of vertices)

Moreover,
find the approximate maximum input size (in terms of vertices) you can measure for all algorithms in a reasonable time (10 seconds at most). 
How big can the input be for all algorithms in a reasonable time for your environment? You should record a video of the execution showing the input size and the total runtime.

Note: run each input instance more than once due to caching issues. Do not take the first one into consideration, as memory misses will be the dominant issue for those.
   

Report Writing:
Prepare a detailed report documenting your findings. The report
should clearly s explain your experiment design, present your results
in an understandable manner (using tables, graphs, etc.), and discuss
your findings.


Expected
Deliverables:


Source code for
Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms implementation.

Input files you have
used.
10 sec. videos of Prim's and Kruskal's

Raw data obtained
from empirical analysis.

Final report
document.


Evaluation
Criteria:

Thoroughness and
creativity in empirical analysis design.

Clarity and depth of
the final report.

Ability to infer and
discuss findings from empirical data.

Note: This project
requires a strong understanding of data structures, particularly
graphs, and a grasp of time complexity analysis. The use of an
advanced programming language is recommended but not mandatory. The
key is to learn, explore, and understand the practical aspects of
these fundamental graph algorithms.
